# koRenderHtml

Renders a [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) view model into an HTML template.

Currently does not work on IE < 9.

A single global function is exposed:

### koRenderHtml(html, model, [map])

* *html* should be an HTML template string, optionally with knockout.js
  bindings.
* *model* should be a knockout.js view model, e.g. as generated by
  ko.mapping.fromJS.
* *map*, if present, should be a function receiving a DOM node and returning
  either a DOM node or *null*. This function is called for each node in the
  resulting DOM. If the return value is *null*, the original node is removed.
  Otherwise, it is replaced by the return value.
