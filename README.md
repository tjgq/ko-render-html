# koRenderHtml

Renders a [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) view model into an HTML template,
optionally filtering unwanted DOM elements.

A single global function is exposed:

### koRenderHtml(html, model, [filter])

* *html* should be an HTML template string, optionally with
  knockout.js bindings.
* *model* should be a knockout.js view model, e.g. as generated by
  ko.mapping.fromJS.
* *filter* should be a function receiving a DOM node and returning
  true if the node should be kept, false otherwise.
